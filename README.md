# CAPS-Project

The Community Air Pollution Sensor (CAPS) project aims to bring education, technology and communities together through understanding and tackling local air pollution. With funding from Google, we have developed a sensor that detects particulate matter of three sizes: 1µm, 2.5µm, 10µm. This pollution causes many respiratory issues as well as other health complications, and although there are council-owned air pollution sensors stationed in our areas there is a lack of more granular, road-by-road data. To combat this we teach secondary school students how to make and code our sensor, after which they use their sensors while going to and from school (or otherwise) to map out their walks to school and the wider local area. Using this data we hope to: 1. Map out the local air pollution to better understand the levels, particularly around school start and end times; 2. Talk to our local councils and implement changes based on the data. 3. Engage local communities in the effects of and the fight against air pollution through citizen science and education.
